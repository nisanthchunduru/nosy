# nosy (previously hugo-notion)

nosy (short for "Notion Sync") gives the ability to author your Hugo blog's blog posts in Notion.

hugo-notion gives you the ability to use Notion as a CMS (Content Management System) for your Hugo site/blog.

`hugo-notion` is a command line (CLI) tool that syncs your Notion page url to your Hugo site's/blog's `content` directory.

## Installation

`hugo-notion` is a Go package. To install it, run

```
go install github.com/nisanthchunduru/hugo-notion@latest
```

`hugo-notion` is also available as a Docker image if you don't have Go lang installed or if you'd like to run `hugo-notion` in a Docker container. Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` that starts `hugo-notion` in a Docker container

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  hugo:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.development
    volumes:
      - .:/opt/blog/
    ports:
      - "1313:1313"
    command: hugo server --watch --buildDrafts --bind 0.0.0.0 --poll 500ms
  hugo-notion:
    image: nisanth074/hugo-notion
    volumes:
      - ./content:/opt/blog/content
    env_file: .env
    working_dir: /opt/blog
```

## Usage

First, create a Notion integration, generate a secret and connect that integration to the Notion page https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#getting-started

Go to your Hugo site directory and run

```
NOTION_TOKEN=your_notion_secret hugo-notion your_notion_page_url
```

`hugo-notion` will sync your Notion page and its children pages to the `content` directory.

`hugo-notion` can also sync your Notion page periodically every 10 seconds. To do so, run

```
hugo-notion -r
```

If you'd like to sync at a different frequency (say, 5 seconds), run

```
hugo-notion -r 5
```

To avoid the hassle of providing your Notion token and your Notion page url to `huno` every time you run it, create an .env file

```
echo 'NOTION_TOKEN=your_notion_secret' > .env
echo 'CONTENT_NOTION_URL=your_notion_page_url >> .env'
```

### Migration

For an easy migration to Notion, you can use my "blog_content" Notion page as a template [https://www.notion.so/ blog_content-0f1b55769779411a95df1ee9b4b070c9](https://www.notion.so/blog_content-0f1b55769779411a95df1ee9b4b070c9)

I recommend that you move one page from Notion to Hugo first, try hugo-notion to sync that page and once you're happy with hugo-notion, move your other Hugo pages to Notion one by one.
